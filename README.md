### Hi there, I'm Chang-LeHung ðŸ‘‹ 
For computer science study, I love the sentence "**What I can not create, I do not understand**" that comes from Richard Feynman most.

### Dive into CPython
I've written a series tutorials(in Chinese) to introduce and demystify the CPython virtual machine, which is available at [Dive into CPython](https://github.com/Chang-LeHung/dive-into-cpython).

### SPL
SPL is a holistic implementation of a newly crafted programming language in Java, where I've tailored its grammar, drawing inspiration from the syntaxes of Java, C/C++, Python, etc. Now I've completed both the compiler and virtual machine. It can support functions, classes, decorators, and functional programming. SPL embodies an interactive shell to provide a better programming experience. In SPL, you can directly inspect the bytecode and exception table of a function by using the 'dis' method. Visit [SPL](https://github.com/Chang-LeHung/SPL) for more details.
